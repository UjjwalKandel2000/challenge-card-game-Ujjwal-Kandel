# Description
This project is a part of the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) program. The task is to build a basis for a card game by using OOP in Python.

For the moment, only the basic functionalities have been implemented:
- A deck of cards is created for the provided number of players.
- Cards are shuffled and distributed among the provided number of players. - Each players plays a card until there is no cards left.

# Timeline
*October 2021*

Time limit: 3 days

This is the first OOP project within the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) to test our understanding of the OOP concept in Python (approx. 3 weeks from the start of the program). The full duration of the program is 7 months. 

# Personal situation

I am currently participating in the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) to dive into the world of Data Science. I know the OOP concept of Java and C++ aswell so understanding the logic was simple for me but I still make some syntax errors because I unintentionally continue to work with the class structure of Java, but I am able to distinguish it over time and practice
