# challenge-card-game-Ujjwal-Kandel

# Description
This project is a part of the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) program. The challange is to build a basis for a card game by using OOP in Python. 


Untill now I have implemented:
- A deck of cards is created .
- Cards are shuffled and distributed among  players.
- A running streamlit web app


# Objectives
Understand how to build a project in a OOP concept

# Repo architecture
