# Description
This project is a part of the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) program. The task is to build a basis for a card game by using OOP in Python.

Untill now I have implemented:
- A deck of cards is created .
- Cards are shuffled and distributed among  players.



# Objectives
Understand how to build a project in a OOP concept

This is the first project where I apply my current knowledge of OOP concepts into this project.

# Personal situation

I am learning at becode AI bootcamp so i can dive into the world of Data Science.
My experience with this project: I know the OOP concept of Java and C++ aswell so understanding the logic was simple for me but I still make some syntax errors because I unintentionally continue to work with the class structure of Java, but I am able to distinguish it over time and practice
